From this section it can be defined the general configuration options of the platform, which do not affect the configuration of each specific participation process. These other configurations are adjusted from the sections of each of the processes.

### Global settings

This is the main configuration section. It is divided into the following tabs: Configuration settings, Features, Banner styles, Banner images, Map configuration.

### Configuration settings

Here are found various parameters of the platform.

### Features

By clicking on the "enable / disable" buttons, sections of each participation process (Debates, Proposals, Processes ( Collaborative Legislation), Participatory Budgeting) or some specific functionality (such as Facebook or Twitter login, Communities in the proposals, Recommendations, Geolocaion, etc.) will appear or disappear from the platform.

### Banner styles and images

To configure the menu options "Site content" â†’ "Manage banners"

### Map configuration

If the geolocation is activated in the Features section and the latitude and longitude and zoom is correctly defined in the section "Global settings" it will be shown a map in this section, which will be the one shown by default in the proposals and projects of participatory budgets to set the proposals.

### Proposal topics

When a user creates a proposal, some default labels are suggested for his proposal. These categories will also be shown in the sidebar of the proposals section. In this section you can define these labels by typing them in the upper field and clicking on the "Create topic" button.

### Manage geozones

When creating proposals from the general section of Proposals, they can be categorized as belonging to a specific geographical area. To define the geographical areas click on the button "Create geozone" and add the name and coordinates (the other fields are not necessary). The coordinates refer to the coordinates in the image that we define in the installation of the platform (see the installation manual), it does not refer to geographical coordinates of latitude and longitude.

### Custom images

Here we will include basic images of the platform, such as the logo that will appear on it in the upper bar.

### Custom content blocks

This option allows us to define HTML blocks that will be embedded in the header or footer of the platform on all pages.
