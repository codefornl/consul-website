In this section are managed the processes of collaborative legislation. The basic process allow three different phases, and in each one can be decided which ones are used. The phases are: debate, proposals and drafting. The debate phase allows to open several questions. The users can give open answers to the questions, and rate other's users answers. The proposals phase allows to the users to write proposals on the issue, and support other users proposals. The drafting phase allows to publish a text. Users can select any part of the text, make comments to it, and rate other comments.

Clicking "Create new process" can be defined which phases will be active (click in the "enabled" checkbox of each phase), the start and end dates of each phase, the information that will be shown in the web page of the process (title, summary for the list of processes, basic description and additional information), and additional documents that can be uploaded when required to that same page as additional information.

Once created the process, clicking on it can be seen different tabs to define each phase:

### Information

Basic information defining the process.

### Debate

The button "create question" allows to add new questions to the phase. It is possible to define closed answers to the question, but it is optional. By default the answers are open.

### Proposals

The "categories" field define which categories will be suggested to the user when creating a new proposal. The categories will be listed during the process, in order to filter the proposals with those categories.

### Drafting

The drafting phase allows to have a first version of the text, and then modify it and publish new versions. To start the process click on the "Create version" button. In the upper part can be written the title of the text and there is an optional field to write a summary of changes with respect to the last version. The status option select between "draft" (the text will not be public, only administrators can preview it) and "published". Once the process has finished, the "Final version" checkbox allows to publish the final text where comments will not be allowed.The link "Launch text editor" can be used to upload the text. When clicking on it, the window will be split in two parts. The left part is used to introduce the text, and the right part will show how will it look in the web page. In order to add styles to the text (as: bold letters, italic, etc.) "markdown" format should be used. It may seem very different to traditional text editors, but is easier than what it seems. When having the text ready (or part of it) click in the "close text editor" and then in the "create version" button
