Users can have additional roles, allowing them to use special interfaces or functionalities of the platform. To mark a user with a role enter in the proper subsection, search the user in the top field by name or email and then click in the "add" button next to the user name. To revoke a role, search the user in the same search field and click the button "delete" next to the user name.

The following roles are available:

### Administrators 

Those users can access to the administrator interface and the rest of the interfaces (manager, moderator, valuator, etc). As seen all the processes and configurations of the platform are managed through the administrator interface. Double check who administer the platform.

### Organisations 

When signing-up to the platform, it can be chosen to create an organisation user instead of a normal one. By default those users, when verified, are highlighted with a small banner of "organisation" next to their user name in the content they create. They may create debates, proposals or comments, but they can not support or vote in the processes. The organisation users created will appear in this section. Administrators can chose to "verify" or "reject" each user. Pending or rejected users have the same functionalities, but will no show the "organisation" banner in the content created. The top tabs organize the users depending if they have been already verified or not ("pending", "all", "verified", "rejected").

### Officials 

Those users are highlighted with a small banner next to their user name in the content they create. The content is also shown with a different style to highlight it. Different levels of "officials" can be defined in the configuration section, and the text that appear in each banner type. The specific level for the user can be changed or removed by the "edit official" button next to the user name. As an example in a city the top level official could be the mayor, the next level the councillors, etc.

### Moderators 

Users with this role can access to the moderator interface, where are listed all the content of the platform flagged as 'inapropriate' by the users. They have the options to hide or confirm the content and block the users.

### Valuators 

This role allows the access to the valuation interface for the participatory budgets. Through this interface they see the proposals that are assigned by the administrators for each specific valuator, and can fill the valuation dossiers.

In addition to defining individual valuators, these can be organized into groups. This is especially useful since generic groups can be defined according to the topics or responsibilities, and then add or eliminate evaluators in the group as necessary. It allows a more flexible control of the evaluation during this phase, as well as several people working in the same set of proposals. To access this possibility, in the upper right part you can find the "Valuators Groups" button.

Once inside, the "Create Evaluator Group" button allows you to define a new group. When creating a group it will be shown in the list on that page and by clicking on it we can see the evaluators that are part of it in case there is one assigned. To assign evaluators to a group we will do it from the initial page of "evaluators". When registering an evaluator (or clicking on it and then on the 'Edit' button of your tab) we will see a selector titled 'Evaluators' group' where we can select if we want to assign a group. This can be changed at any time.

If a project of participatory budgets is assigned to a group of evaluators, all the evaluators that at that moment are defined as part of the group will have access to it.

### Managers 

Those users have the permission to access the managers interface. In this interface managers can create and verify users accounts, and perform tasks for the users are creating or supporting proposals, etc. The common use of this role is for public workers in the institution office, to help the citizens to interact with the participation processes.

### Users 

All registered users of the platform can be found here with their user information and a link to their user page.
