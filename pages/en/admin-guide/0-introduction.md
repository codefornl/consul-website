CONSUL has different independent interfaces from which can be managed everything that happens in the platform easily. These interfaces are the following: Administration, Moderation, Valuation, Management, and Polling officers.

Administrators can access all of them, and additionally assign permissions to other users to access any of them, and thus be able to collaborate with the management of the processes in a decentralized and secure manner.

In the following sections we will explain the use of each of the interfaces.
