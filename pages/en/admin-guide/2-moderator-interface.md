![Screenshot of the Moderation interface](/assets/screenshot.jpg)

Moderators and administrators can access to this interface. Here are listed all the content of the platform flagged as 'inapropriate' by the users. Moderators have the options to hide or confirm the content and block the users.

When a user marks in a Proposal / Debate / Comment the option to "report as inappropriate", will appear in this list. For each element will be shown the title, date, number of complaints (how many different users have marked the option to report) and the text of the Proposal / Debate / Comment will appear.

To the right of each item appears a box that we can mark to select several ones from the list. Once one or more are selected, we find three buttons at the bottom of the page to perform actions on them:

* __Hide__: will hide those elements in the platform.
* __Block authors__: will cause the author of that element to stop being able to access the web, and also to hide in the platform all the Proposals / Debates / Comments of that user.
* __Mark as viewed__: used when we consider that these elements should not be moderated, that their content is correct, and thus they should stop being shown in this list of inappropriate elements.

To facilitate the management, above we find a filter with the sections:
* __Pending__: Proposals / Discussions / Comments on which has not yet been pressed "hide", "block" or "mark as viewed", and therefore should still be checked
* __All__: showing all the Proposals / Discussions / Comments on the web, and not just those marked as inappropriate.
* __Marked as viewed__: those that some moderator has marked as viewed and therefore seem correct.It is advisable to check the "pending" section regularly.

__Block users__

The search form allows us to find any user by entering their username or email, and block it once found. By blocking it, the user will not be able to access the web again, and all their Proposals / Discussions / Comments will be hidden and will no longer be visible on the web.
