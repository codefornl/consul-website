### Homepage

In this section you can configure what is shown on the initial screen of the platform when you enter it.

The first menu allows you to define the "Header" by clicking the "Create header" button. This is a first band that appears just below the menu bar, and allows to give the most visibility to what seems most relevant. The band can be configured with a title that will appear in a large font,a small description, an additional image, and a link that will be accessed by pressing the button that will appear in the band.

The next element to configure is the "Cards". These cards are rectangles of smaller size than the band of the header, and located below, which will allow to highlight other processes or relevant links, although less than the header. Several cards can be created with the "Create card" button, and will be placed one after the other. The cards are defined in the same way with title, description, image and link.

Then we can activate four different elements, with the "Enable" buttons: Proposals, Debates, Processes and Recommendations. Proposals will show us the proposals that appear in the top of the “Proposals” section of the platform. Debates are the same, but referring to the “Debates” general section of the platform. Processes will activate a format similar to the previous Cards, but with the content of the last processes that are active in the "Processes" or "Collaborative Legislation" section of the platform. In these three cases we can select the number of elements that will be displayed with respect to each one. The last option "Recommendations" activates a module at the bottom of the page, which will only be seen when one is logged in as a user on the platform. When this is the case, it will show three debates and three recommended proposals for our user, depending on the debates and proposals that we have previously supported. This automatic recommendation system selects the labels of the debates and proposals that we have supported and looks for other elements with the same labels. If we enter with our user in the Debates or Proposals section, in the upper part of the debates or proposals we find different filters to order the elements: "More active / Highest rated / New / Recommended". This last filter is the same one that is used to show recommended elements in the initial page.

### Custom pages
In this subsection can be created information pages for the users. Click in the "Create new page" button to define it. The page includes a title, subtitle and text. The language of the page can be defined, and also the "slug" (the url that will be shown in the web browser). The status can be chosen between "draft" (while we are creating it) and "published" (visible to the users). And two additional options can be selected: showing it in the "help" section of the platform, and including a "print" button on it to make easier for the users to print it.

### Custom banners

This section allows you to configure banners that will be displayed at the top of the Debates and Proposals sections of the platform. They will allow to highlight other processes or links that seem especially relevant.By clicking on the "Create a banner" button we can fill in the following information: Style. The style of fonts and colors of the banner. Image. The background image of the banner. Post started and ended at. The banner will be displayed automatically during the selected period. Title and description The text that will be displayed on the banner. Link. The URL to which you will direct us when you click on the banner. The banners are saved and can be reused later.
