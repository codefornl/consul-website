This section allows you to enable offline voting polls for both "Voting" and "Participatory Budgeting" processes. The booths are managed through the “Polling officers” interface to ensure that no person can vote twice in the ballot box and on the digital platform. It also allows monitoring of the evolution of voting in ballot boxes in a decentralized manner.

To be able to use the voting booths we must first define the voting. This will be done in the "Voting" menu or in the "Participatory Budgeting" menu (in the "Manage booths" button) depending on the case. Once the voting has been created, you can define the polls, poll officers and assign the corresponding shifts.

### Poll officers

List of users with the role of "officers". This users are allowed during a voting to access to the officers interface (that will be explained later), where is managed the voting in physical booths. These officers check that people vote correctly, that nobody votes twice, and check the results of the physical booth. To assign the role of "officer" search the user in the top field, and then click in the button next to the user name.


### Booths location

Booths can be given a name, and their location, in order to manage them easily. Click "Add booth" to define a new booth and its location. The "booth kind" option differentiates between a "physical booth" where people vote in a ballot box, and a "digital booth" where people vote directly in a tablet or computer. The first one implies a manual process of counting the votes and checking the results by the officers.

### Booths assignments

The platform controls which ballot boxes are used for each active poll and which officers are in each ballot box. The "manage assignments" button allows to select which ballot boxes will be used for each poll, by clicking the "assign booth" next to the selected booth.

### Manage shifts

Clicking in "Manage shifts" for each active ballot box officers can be searched. The "Edit shifts" button right to each officer allows to add a shift for that officer in the ballot box. Shifts can be defined as "Collect votes" for the days the poll is open, and "Scrutiny" for the days following the poll. This two tasks allow different options for the officer in the "officer interface" during the voting process. Several shifts can be assigned to each officer.
