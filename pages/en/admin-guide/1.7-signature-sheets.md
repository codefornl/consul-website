If it is allowed to support proposals or participatory budget projects by signing a traditional signature sheet, that part of the process may be managed here. This section allows to upload the signatures so it can be checked if the citizens are allowed to support the proposal/project, and not having duplicate or unverified signatures. To upload new signatures click on "new signature sheet". Select if it is a proposal or a participatory budget project, add the ID of it (it is shown in the web page of the proposal/project), and then add the citizen document numbers separated by commas. When clicking in "Create signature sheet" the system will verify each signature, and add the valid supports to the proposal/project. Take into account that the verification system is slow. You may come back later to the signature sheet web page to check its result. All the signature sheets will be shown in the section, with a link to each one showing all the information and the result after creating it, for any additional verification.
