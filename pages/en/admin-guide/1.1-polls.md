Section to manage the voting processes. Each poll may contain several questions, may be configured to be voted by everybody or only by the residents of an area, and may have some specific voting booths to vote it. Different polls with different configurations may run simultaneously. 

Polls. List of polls. The "Create poll" button allows the initial definition of the poll. "Name", "Summary" and "Description" will be the public information presented on the poll web page (each poll has its own web page, listed all of them in the voting section of the platform). Voting online will be possible between the "Start date" and the "End date". An "Image" can be uploaded, and will be shown in the list of polls in the voting section. The checkbox "restricted by geozone" allows restricting the users who can vote on the poll to a specific area.

In the first form is only needed the question and selecting the poll where it will be included. In the following form can be added the possible answers with the "Add answer" button. Each answer can include a description, images, documents and videos. All this information will be shown in the poll web page, below all answers.

If you want to enable ballot boxes in addition to digital voting, this can be configured through the menu "Voting booths", that will be introduced later.Once a poll has been defined through these previous sections (and through the “Vooting booths” menu if this is the case), the poll can be accessed in the "polls" section. Clicking in the poll can be seen the questions, booth, officers, recounting and results (these last two options once the poll has started).
 
In the recounting and result section can be found links to see the partial results for each booth. Notice that the recounting section differentiate between two types of recounting: the recounts (made by the officers) and the votes (registered automatically by the platform). This comparison helps checking that the process was done correctly. Once the poll has finished, is the results section are found two checkboxes to do public the results and the statistics of the voting. Those results will be shown in the public voting page.
