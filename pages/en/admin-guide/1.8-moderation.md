Moderation of the platform is done from the moderation interface, which we will explain later. However, this section allows you to follow up the moderatio activities. It shows all the content moderated by moderators or administrators of the platform, as well as the activity of the moderators to verify that it is being done correctly. All moderation activities are kept in a log and can be verified by other administrators. The subsections 'hidden proposals', 'hidden debates','hidden comments' and ‘hidden proposal notifications’ work in the same way. Each show the list of moderated content, with buttons "restore" and "confirm moderation" next to each content. The first one undo the moderation action, making the content public again. The second one confirm that the moderation was properly done and move the content to the "confirmed" tab. The confirmation action does not change anything publicly, is just useful for internal purposes of review of moderation.The subsection 'blocked users' shows all users that have been blocked in the platform. In the same way, the block action can be undone or confirmed.The subsection 'activity of the moderators' contains a log of each moderation action carried out and the date and author who made it, to ensure that it is carried out correctly.
