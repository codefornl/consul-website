![Screenshot of the Valuation interface](/assets/screenshot.jpg)

Valuators and administrators can access to this interface for the valuation of projects of the participatory budgeting processes. Through the administration interface the projects are assigned to different valuators or groups of valuators. Each valuator can see in this interface only the projects assigned for him, and fill the valuation dossier of each project. Thus the valuation can be done in a decentralized way, simplifying the work for each valuator.

In order to be shown here, the projects should be assigned to the valuator, and also marked the checkbox "show to valuator" in the administrator interface. Thus the administrators may ration the work that has been done by each valuator in different time periods, and not show all the projects from the beginning, if that is useful.

When accessing the interface is shown the current participatory budget process ongoing, and an "evaluate" button to start the valuation of projects. In the next window in the top is shown the number of projects for each heading, and then two tabs to organize the projects: "Under valuation" and "Valuation finished"

Clicking in each project can be seen the public information of the project, the administrators and valuators assigned, the current state of the valuation dossier and a space for internal comments between the valuators and the administrators. This comment section is not public, is used only for internal debate and clarification between the people in charge of the valuation of the project.

Clicking in the "Edit dossier" link the valuation dossier form is shown. First has to be selected the feasibility of the project: pending (by default), feasible or not feasible.

When clicking in "feasible" the following fields are to be filled:
- __Price (mandatory)__. The price of the project will be shown during the final voting phase, and used to calculate how many projects can vote each user.
- __Price explanation (optional)__. If this field is filled, the explanation will be shown in the project page. This field can be used to explain how the price was calculated, or how the project can be executed.
- __Cost__ during the first year (optional, not public). This field is only used for internal purposes. Will not be published at any time.
- __Time scope (optional, not public)__. This field is only used for internal purposes. Will not be published at any time.

When clicking the "not feasible" option the only field required is the following:
- __Feasibility explanation (mandatory)__. Here it is explained why the project was declared infeasible.

When the dossier is marked as "Valuation finished" and the changes saved, the project will appear in the 'unfeasible projects' list publicly, and the feasibility explanation published in the project page. Also a email will be sent to the author of the project, with the feasibility explanation. Take into account that this mail is sent and the explanation published in the platform at the same moment the valuation is set as finished and the changes saved.

When clicking in the "valuation finished" checkbox and in the "save changes" button, the dossier will be closed. The valuator will not be allowed to do any further change (except if an administrator undo that checkbox).

If the "save changes" button is clicked without marking the "valuation finished" checkbox, the information of the fields will be saved, to keep working on them at another time.
