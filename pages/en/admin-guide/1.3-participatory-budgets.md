Through participatory budgeting the users can decide together how to spend a budget.

The process may include the optional following phases: "Information", to publish the basic information on the process before the participation phases start. "Accepting projects", users can write projects for spending the budget. "Reviewing projects", all projects are published and new ones can not be added, so it can be detected mistakes in the existing projects. "Selecting projects", user can support the projects they like to prioritize them. "Valuating projects", administrators and valuators can select if the projects are feasible or not, and the cost for each one. "Publishing projects prices", the feasible projects selected for the voting phase are published, but still the voting is closed, users can check if the information and valuation has been done correctly. "Voting projects" where the selected projects are voted. "Reviewing voting", in order to check the results. "Finished budgets", to present the final results once the process has finished.

The projects are categorized within "groups", and "headings" for each group. Each user can support and vote projects from each group, but only from some limited amount of headings of each group (one by default). As an example, in the participatory budgeting of a city, one of the groups could be "Projects for the whole city", and other group could be "Projects for a specific district". And then inside the second group would be one heading for each district. All users would vote the projects for the city, and projects of one district of their choice.

Click on "Create new budget" to define the name of the process, the currency, and selectthe initial phase. In the following window, clicking in "Add new group" new groups may be defined. 

For each group can be added as many headings as wanted. The heading is defined by the name, the amount of money, and optionally the population (if the heading corresponds to an area). The max number of headings that can be selected to support or vote can be defined for each group independently with the "Edit group" button.

The main section contains two tabs: "open" and "finished" budgets. The "Edit budget" link allows to define which phases will be active, and the start and end date for each phase. In each budget the link "manage projects" show us the list of projects created by the users:

The list of projects include the following fields: "ID", "Title", "Supports" (of the 'selecting projects' phase), "Administrator" (the projects can be assigned to administrators, to check they are properly evaluated, and have a general overview over some headings or groups), "Valuator" (users with the valuator role will see their assigned projects through their valuation interface, where they can evaluate them), "_Valuation Group_" (valuators can be organized in groups) , "_Scope of operation_" (heading of the project) , "_Feasibility_" (undecided by default, and then feasible or unfeasible once evaluated), "_Show to valuators_" (valuators will see only their assigned projects marked with this checkbox, in order to prioritize which ones have to evaluated), "_Val. Fin._" (describing if the valuation has been marked as finished), "_Selected_" (feasible projects with finished valuation can be marked as selected; those will be the projects shown in the final voting phase).

The projects can be filtered according to the following tabs: All, Without assigned admin (no administrator assigned), Without assigned valuator (no valuator assigned), Under valuation (projects with valuator assigned), Valuation finished, Winners.Other filters can be found in the top part: Administrator, Valuator, Headings, Tags (tags set by the administrators, not by the users). Also "advanced filters" that allow filtering by:Feasible, Selected, Undecided or Unfeasible projects, or the minimum amount of supports to be shown in the list, and a search field to search by ID or word. All those filters and tabs can be combined to produce very specific searches.

The link "download current selection" allows downloading the projects shown in the bottom table in a csv file.

Clicking in the title of a project a new page show us the information of the project. First the public information of the project. Then the "Classification" section where the administrator and valuators assigned and the tags are shown, and can be edited with the link "Edit classification".

It is important to keep in mind that you should not change the classification of which heading or group a proposal belongs to during the support or voting phase. The possibility of supporting or voting on a proposal depends on the heading in which it is classified. Therefore, someone who could be voting on a proposal in a heading may not be able to vote the same proposal in another heading. Therefore, if the classification of a proposal is changed, the supports or votes that it has at that moment will be eliminated. Although this will be alert to the administrator, it must be taken into account during the management of the process.

The following section is the "Dossier", where the feasibility and price are shown and edited. When editing the report of a project, will be displayed the same interface that "evaluators" users see through the “evaluation interface”, that will be explained later. It will be explained in more detail in that section, but it is important here to bear in mind that if a project is declared unfeasible and the project report is finalized, the report of unfeasibility will be public on the project website, and it will be sent at that moment an email to the author with that report.

The next section is the "Valuation comments"; those comments between the administrators and the valuators are not public. Are used for internal discussion on the projects. And finally the "Milestones" section.

The Milestones section is used to publish the evolution of the finally selected project once the participatory process has finished. A timeline will be published in the public page of the project with all milestones. Clicking in "Create new milestone" the following information can be added: status (to categorize the projects, for example: "studying the project, contracting, building, finished"; the possible status can be defined in the bottom link), description of the milestone, date of publication of the milestone, images and documents to show in the milestone. The date and a status or a description are the only mandatory fields.
