![Screenshot of the Management interface](/assets/screenshot.jpg)

Managers and administrators can access to this interface. Here managers can create and verify users accounts, and perform tasks for the users are creating or supporting proposals, etc. The common use of this role is for public workers in the institution office, to help the citizens to interact with the participation process.

The following options are available:

- __Users__. The managers can create or verify user accounts through this option. All the other options require first to access through this section, to select the user whose actions will be performed.
- __Edit user account__. This option allows to reset the password of an user by two ways: via email (this is the most common way, the user will receive an email with a link to reset the password), manually (in case the user has no access to his email, a random password can be generated, or typed by the own user through this interface)
- __Create proposal__. Here is shown the form to create a proposal. When created, it will appear in the platform as created by the user.
- __Support proposal__. A search field is shown in the top of the page to search a proposal. Once found if clicking in the "support" button next to it, the proposal will register a support coming from the user. The final voting of proposals or participatory budgets projects, being a much more delicate process, is not managed from this interface. To manage this process, in the administration interface there is the ‘Voting booths’ option.
- __Create budget investment__. Here is shown the form to create a project for the current participatory budgeting process, if the 'accepting projects' phase is open. When created, it will appear in the platform as created by the user.
- __Support budget investment__. A search field is shown in the top of the page to search a project for the current participatory budgeting process, if the 'supporting projects' phase is open. Once found if clicking in the "support" button next to it, the project will register a support coming from the user.
- __Print proposals__. This section facilitates to print part of the list of the proposals.
- __Print budget investment__. This section facilitates to print part of the list of the investment budgets.
- __Send invitations__. The field can be filled with a list of emails separated by commas. When clicking in the "send invitations" button an email will be sent to each email address inviting the person so sign up in the platform.
